# JavaScript classes coding challenge

Welcome to your second coding challgenge. This task is about something new to you: JavaScript classes.  
It may happen in some coding challenge that they give you a task about something that you have never worked on before. They usually give examples and what they want to test is your ability to understand and implement something new but simple in a short amount of time.

In JavaScript, classes are types of functions / templates for creating objects.  
They are defined with the `class` keyword and they can be used to support some of the Object-Oriented principles (note that JS is not a OOP language by default, differently from Java).

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.

Make a bit of research about OOP and then go and look at the `car.html` file and the `car.js` file. Open the html with the live server and test it. Read all the comments and try to implement the missing method described at the end of the JS file.

When you are done, try to do the same as the car class in the `tv.html` and `tv.js`.

The real task though is to create a shopping cart OOP model and display it on the browser (you will find more information in the `shopping.html` and `shopping.js` files).

It should not take more than 2 days to complete this challenge. Please make the shopping cart page look nice (you can use any CSS framework or Sass if you want).
If you cannot complete this task in time, write some comments and explain how you would solve it if you had more time.

Good luck!
